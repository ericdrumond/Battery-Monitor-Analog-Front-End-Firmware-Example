# Battery-Monitor-Analog-Front-End-Firmware-Example

This library implements all basic functions from the Battery Monitor or Analog Front-End BQ76925 IC from Texas Instruments interfacing with a STM32 microcontroller via i2c. 

The LL (low-level) driver library from ST was used on this project. 

Note that this library is currently in testing phase and it's not on release version yet.
